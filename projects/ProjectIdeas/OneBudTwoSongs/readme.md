# README

- Create an electron desktop app that can two songs simulanously
- One song in each bud/speaker/earphone
- Control should be unique i.e if left ear is tapped twice => switch previous song on left ear only

- TIPS:
  - Create a music app
  - Allow user to split the app into halves, one for each half
  - Allow panning on each side, default should be 1 and -1 (right and left)
